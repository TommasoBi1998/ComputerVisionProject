# Project for the Computer Vision course.

Our project is based on the union of a Superpixel segmentation technique and a color based skin detection algorithm.
We divided our approach in 7 steps:
- Superpixels creation.
- Features extraction.
- SIFT quantization.
- Mask creation.
- Histogram aggregation.
- SVM classification.
- Skin color refinement.
- Merge superpixels.
